# Readable - udacity-react-readable

_Second project of the Udacity React Nanodegree_

This is an example of using React-Redux to create a micro-blog, complete with comments and
ranking.

## INSTALLATION

### API

To start you will need to have a running copy of [reactnd-project-readable-starter](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) to run alongside this so it has something to connect to.

Once downloaded, you will need to follow the installation instructions, mainly:

* `cd api-server`
* `npm install`
* `node server`

### READABLE

In another terminal window you can then run *Readable* using:

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

## USAGE

Once installed, *Readable* will automatically fire up in your browser.

## TODO

There is no mechanism for session tracking. Users can not log in and the honor sytem is in full force when
adding your name to comments or posts.
